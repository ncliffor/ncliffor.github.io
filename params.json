Not enough stuff? Time to visit the auctions. I loved working on the [`sortable table`](https://github.com/ncliffor/biddr/blob/master/app/helpers/table_sort_helper.rb) which protects from SQL injection through the helper and [`categories_controller`](https://github.com/ncliffor/biddr/blob/master/app/controllers/categories_controller.rb#L30)\r\n* [Taskr](https://github.com/ncliffor/taskr) - Keep track of all your To Do lists.
